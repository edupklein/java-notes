Run a Java class file in JRE (see examples below):
- java ClassFile.class
- java ClassFile
- java C:\Users\I753130\IdeaProjects\ClassFile.class


Compile a Java file to binary code:
- javac ClassFile.java
--- This will create a new file called ClassFile.class


Building/creating JAR file for the Java project:
- jar cvf ProjectName.jar .
--- This won't work because the MANIFEST.MF is created automatically and will not specify the class to start running the application

- jar cvmf TC-MANIFEST.MF ProjectName.jar .
--- This specifies the manifest file named TC-MANIFEST.MF to be considered when creating the jar file
--- For this to work, there needs to be a TC-MANIFEST.MF file in the folder
--- Example:
----- TC-MANIFEST.MF
------- Main-Class: com.example.MainClass

Running JAR file:
- java -jar ProjectName.jar


WAR FILE:
Go to the folder of the project with the source code and run:
javac MyClass.java -classpath servlet-api.jar

To transform this into a war file:
jar cfv my_webapp.war hello.jsp WEB-INF
